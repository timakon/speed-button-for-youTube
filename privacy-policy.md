# Privacy Policy – Speed Button for YouTube

This browser extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.

The extension only stores a single setting: your preferred video playback speed (for example, 1.25x). This value is saved locally in the browser using `chrome.storage` in order to automatically apply your preferred speed on YouTube videos.

No browsing history, video content, account information, or any other personal data is collected or sent to external servers.

The extension does not use analytics, ads, tracking pixels, or third-party scripts.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer at: **skukler19@gmail.com**.
